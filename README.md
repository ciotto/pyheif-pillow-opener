## Changelog

### 0.3.2

* Depends on latest pyheif.

### 0.3.1

! This version requires pyheif with `pyheif.open` API. As of 2021.11.25 this API
isn't released and is in pyheif's master. See `install-pyheif-master-pillow-latest`
target in the `Makefile` to install it.

* Fixed potential vulnerability with arbitrary data in exif metadata.

### 0.3.0

! This version requires pyheif with `pyheif.open` API. As of 2021.11.25 this API
isn't released and is in pyheif's master. See `install-pyheif-master-pillow-latest`
target in the `Makefile` to install it.

* `pyheif.open` API is used for lazy images loading.
* Fixed an error when the plugin tries to load any ISOBMFF files.
* AVIF files should work before, but now this is official.
* Patched versions of `pyheif` and `libheif` with exposed transformations is supported.
  In this case opened image isn't transformed on loading and orientation is stored
  in EXIF `Orientation` tag like for all other image formats.
  This is faster and consumes less memory.

### 0.2.0

* No need to register, works after import.
* Fill `info['icc_profile']` on loading.
* Close and release file pointer after loading.
* Deconding without custom HeifDecoder(ImageFile.PyDecoder).
